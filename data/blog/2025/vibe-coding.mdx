## Step 1: architecture.md

Open ChatGPT (4o, not o1/o3/o4) and say:

```markdown
I’m building a [description of your product - the more detailed the better]. Use Next.js for frontend, Supabase for DB + auth.
Give me the full architecture about this project:

- File + folder structure
- What each part does
- Where state lives, how services connect
  Format this entire document in markdown.
```

Save its output as `architecture.md` and throw it in an empty folder where your project will live.

## Step 2: tasks.md

Now say:

```markdown
Using that architecture, write a granular step-by-step plan to build the MVP.
Each task should:

- Be incredibly small + testable
- Have a clear start + end
- Focus on one concern
  I’ll be passing this off to an engineering LLM that will be told to complete one task at a time, allowing me to test in between.
```

Save it as `tasks.md`. Again, throw it in the folder.

## Step 3: Cursor

```markdown
You’re an engineer building this codebase.
You've been given `architecture.md` and `tasks.md`.

- Read both carefully. There should be no ambiguity about what we’re building.
- Follow `tasks.md` and complete one task at a time.
- After each task, stop. I’ll test it. If it works, commit to GitHub and move to the next.
```

Include this as well - this is crucial:

### CODING PROTOCOL

```markdown
Coding Instructions

- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don’t break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. Supabase/AWS config), tell me clearly
```

This system fixes the biggest problem with vibe coding:

You’re not dumping everything into the IDE and praying.
You’re giving it a roadmap.
You’re keeping it on rails.
You stay in control.

This workflow lets you ship clean, testable AI-assisted code - without the spiral.

Normally I'd ask you to follow me for the playbook but this is literally it. Good luck
