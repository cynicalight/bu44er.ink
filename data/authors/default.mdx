## Hi there <Twemoji emoji="waving-hand" />

I am a college student from China. My undergraduate major is Cybersecurity. I have a strong interest in web security, web dev, and **machine learning**.

In my spare time, I enjoy **photography** <Twemoji emoji="camera" />, capturing the world and life.

**Movies** are also something I enjoy. My all-time favorite is [Casablanca](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/).

Also, my favorite band is **the Beatles**, and [the White Album](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_(album)>) is the one I listen to most often.

This blog website records my thoughts. I hope it can be helpful to others. This is the journey that has brought me to where I am today. <Twemoji emoji="mending-heart" />

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.
